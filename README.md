# PNP4Nagios

This is a fork of [@lingej's original pnp4nagios package](https://github.com/lingej/pnp4nagios).

As a long-time user of `pnpnagios`, I am trying to give the project a
good home as we work to further develop and enhance this project. Please
contact me if you would like to help.

The original source was retired on commit 5e09f538373ac4310a13355746bb3d3a10eb7bef
(Version pnp-0.6.?? ??/??/2017 on 2022/Jan/16). Many thanks to Joerg Linge and his
awesome contributors for what we have, now!


## Getting Started

For now, I'm advocating installing from source (**my** source), as we move
forward into further developing this project.

Instructions can be found in
[this gist](https://gist.github.com/russellvt/051fa43592778a41e53cb423b791bab6).


## Documentation

While it's still up, the bext source of documentation is at
https://docs.pnp4nagios.org. I will work on reproducing that, in some form,
soon.


## About Me

I am a long time Nagios/Icinga/Monitoring/Devops Professional. I've been
"the toolsguy" long from "devops" was even a "new" term.



## build RPM from git

The spec file is in the "dist" subdirectory.  Install git-build-rpm (it's on
github) and, as an example:

cd (main directory of this git package; where this README.md file is located)
git build-rpm --rpm-dir /home/local/lane/rpmbuild --dist .fc35

The --rpm-dir option is to keep the .srpm file from the build, the
--dist option is to avoid the longwinded "-%{version}-%{release}%{timestamp}.%{dist}..." package name.
